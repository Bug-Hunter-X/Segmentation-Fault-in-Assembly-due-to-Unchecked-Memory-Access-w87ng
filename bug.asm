mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated as ebx + ecx * 4.  The bug arises if ecx is a large value, causing the calculated address to exceed the bounds of allocated memory or even the address space. This leads to a segmentation fault or access violation.
